# What is it ?
It's the basic Dark+ with some saturation.  

# Thought process
In vscode, choose Dark+ theme.  
Think it's a bit too gentle.  
`Ctrl+p` and type `>Generate Color`.  
Save this to file.  
Generate go code to saturate every piece of color on this file.  
Copy the file gemerated to the `themes` folder.  
Publish on vscode market.  
Enjoy ! :-)  
*well, sort of...*
